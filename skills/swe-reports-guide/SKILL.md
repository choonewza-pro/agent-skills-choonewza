# Dev Reports Guide for Executives

This skill defines the directory structure and writing standards for development and bug fix reports destined for company leadership and executives.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MANDATORY PREREQUISITE**: Before writing or modifying ANY development report, status update, or executive summary, you **MUST** read and follow the instructions in the [swe-management-talk](../swe-management-talk/SKILL.md) agent skill. Do not rely on memory — always read the skill file to ensure correct tone, vocabulary, and formatting.

## 1. Directory Structure & File Locations

All reports for executives must be stored in the appropriate subdirectories under `./docs/dev-reports/` as Markdown (`.md`) files:

| Report Type | Directory Path | Example File Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Features** | `./docs/dev-reports/features/` | `./docs/dev-reports/features/occasion-mode.md` |
| **Bug Fixes** | `./docs/dev-reports/fix-bugs/` | `./docs/dev-reports/fix-bugs/2026-06-26-fix-authentication.md` |

*Note: If the target directory does not exist, create it. If there is an existing legacy folder named `fix-bug`, align or migrate files to the standard `./docs/dev-reports/fix-bugs/` path as appropriate.*

## 2. Writing Standards & Tone

When writing reports for leadership, strictly adhere to the following principles from the `management-talk` skill:

1. **Audience Focus**: Write for engineering-savvy non-engineers (VPs, directors, PMs). They care about *state, customer/business impact, ownership, and next steps*.
2. **Language**: Use professional, polite, and elegant Thai (unless English is explicitly requested) since the project UI is in Thai and the target audience is Thai leadership.
3. **Information Filtering**:
   - **Keep**: Product names, high-level framework names, system-level component names (e.g., Prisma, PostgreSQL, Server Actions, clean architecture layers).
   - **Strip**: Code-level details, function names, raw database column names, file paths, commit SHAs, line numbers, and internal debugging minutiae.
   - **Translate**: Technical mechanisms into plain-English/plain-Thai cause-and-effect (e.g., instead of "caching in local storage to prevent hydrating mismatch", write "saving user preference in browser storage to prevent showing the pop-up repeatedly").

## 3. Required Report Sections

Each executive report should be structured with the following sections:

1. **Header**: Clear title, date, and development status (e.g., Completed, Staging, In Progress).
2. **บทสรุปผู้บริหาร (Executive Summary / TL;DR)**: A bolded summary of what the feature/fix is and its current state.
3. **คุณค่าทางธุรกิจและผลกระทบต่อผู้ใช้งาน (Business Value & UX Impact)**: Bullet points explaining how this improves the brand, solves customer pain points, or increases efficiency.
4. **รายละเอียดความสามารถหลัก (Key Capabilities)**: Plain-language details of what was developed or resolved.
5. **โครงสร้างระบบและความปลอดภัย (Technical Foundation & Security)**: A high-level description of the architecture and security measures.
6. **สถานะปัจจุบันและแผนงานถัดไป (Current Status & Next Steps)**: A checklist of completed tasks and near-term milestones (e.g., Deploy to Staging, QA testing, Admin guidelines, Production release).
